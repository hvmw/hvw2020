 - {title: "Workshop", image: "workshop.jpg", text: "A workshop for logicians in computer science, held in memory of Helmut Veith, with an emphasis on the combination of research and social activities. In 2014, Helmut contacted Georg (Moser) with the following idea." }
 - {title: "The Idea", image: "idea.jpg", text: "Folgende Idee (heute am Lift): Vielleicht sollte man eine Tradition eines Logik-in-CS Workshops in Österreich einführen, so nach dem Prinzip am Vormittag arbeiten, am Nachmittag auf der Piste (oder im Bad). Wenn man das zu einem Randtermin macht (März), kann man wahrscheinlich ein gutes Hotel zu einem vernünftigen Preis bekommen, oder es gibt ein Schullandheim etc." }
 - {title: "Research and Social Activities", image: "skiing.jpg", text: "This workshop, now in its fourth edition, aims to bring this idea to life. It will be held from Monday, January 27, to Wednesday, January 29, 2020, at the Schlosshotel Seewirt, Turracher Höhe, Austria, with arrival on Sunday, January 26, and includes three nights accommodation." }
