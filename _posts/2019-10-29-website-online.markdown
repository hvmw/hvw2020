The website for HVW'20, the fourth installment of the Austrian Workshop on
Logic in Computer Science in Memory of Helmut Veith, is online. The workshop
will again take place at the Schlosshotel Seewirt, situated right in the middle
of the Turracher HÃ¶he skiing area. As last year, the workshop will consist of
three days, where each day starts with a half-day of talks, and leaves time for
social activities (like skiing) in the afternoon.

The following is a summary of the most important points about the workshop:

* **Arrival**: January 26, 2020, in the evening
* **Dates**: January 17, 2020 - January 29, 2020
* **Included**: three nights accommodation at Schlosshotel Seewirt
